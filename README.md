## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Engage in conversation with the AI assistant through a user-friendly chat interface.

- **Intelligent Responses:** Utilizes advanced technologies to process user queries and generate intelligent, context-aware responses.

- **Periodic Code Highlighting:** Enhances interaction with periodic code highlighting, improving readability for code-related responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** A Python web framework used to set up the server and define routes.

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Frontend technologies for creating a visually appealing and interactive webpage.

- **Bootstrap:** CSS framework for styling the webpage.
